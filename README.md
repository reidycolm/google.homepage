# google.homepage
Recreating the google homepage which was my first assignment as part of the odin project. View the page [here](https://reidycolm.github.io/google.homepage/)

Gave me a better understanding of the flexbox layout and how to use dev tools when working on something as a way of fixing errors. Also was good practice on how to use git.
